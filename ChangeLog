29 Feb 2003 - version 2.5

- Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 263 specifies that the
  character set encoding of the source code should be 
  provided in a comment line at the very top of the field.
  This will allow the python parser to interpret the file
  using the specified character set encoding.  If I had only
  English strings in here, I would not have had to worry, but
  do to the special characters in some of the translation 
  strings, python 2.3 was generating a warning about the lack
  of a character set encoding statement.

  This release purely adds the encoding statement so that 
  python 2.3 users no longer see a warning.

  More information on PEP 263 can be found at:

11 Nov 2002 - version 2.4

- There is now the ability to generate a DocBook XML <qandaset>
   file which could then be processed using XSLT tools into a
   PDF file or other format (including HTML).  Usage is through
   the "DocBookXML" config that was added, as in:

      ./makefaq.py -c DocBookXML

   plus whatever other command-line options are desired. The 
   default output file for this config is "faq-output.xml".
- Added '-N' command-line option was added that will suppress 
   numbering of questions and answers.  This was desirable for
   the DocBook XML generation as the standard DocBook XSLT 
   stylesheets can provide numbering for FAQ entries.
- Added the attribute 'self.numberQuestions' to the DefaultConfig
   and set it to TRUE so that all questions and categories are
   numbered by default.
- Added the attribute 'self.createTOC' to the DefaultConfig
   and set it to TRUE so that a TOC will be generated by default.
   However, this can be overridden in subclassed configs in
   order to suppress the creation of a TOC by setting the value
   to FALSE.  As an example, this was done in the DocBookXMLConfig.
- German strings updated (Fabian Melzow)
- Portugeuse strings updated (Mauro Persano)

---------------------------------------------------
10 Aug 2002 - version 2.3

- Added '-j' command line option to insert links to jump to
   the top of the page.
- Changed '-r' option to '-r 1' to get ready for next version
   which will start using XML format.
- Added link in faqheader.html to CSS stylesheet

---------------------------------------------------
13 Jul 2001 - version 2.2

- Fixed PrintTimeStamp to take into account the fact that on some
   non-Linux platforms the locale can apparently not be set. This
   was verified on Windows, HP-UX and FreeBSD 3.x/4.x.
- Added Makefile to automate installation.

---------------------------------------------------
22 Apr 2001 - version 2.1

- Fixed bug in strftime call in PrintTimeStamp function (caught by
   Michael Wiedmann) so that revision time is now correct
- Added suggested modification (commented out) by Nicolas Devillard
   to turn blank lines in data file into <p> tags
- Included man page created by Michael Wiedmann
- Created INSTALL file to explain installation (eventually a make
   file needs to be created)
- Included Portugeuse phrases provided by César A. K. Grossmann

---------------------------------------------------
2 Apr 2001 - version 2.0

- Changed data file format to allow multi-line entries.
- Included support for LANG environment variable and better
   localization.

---------------------------------------------------
19 Mar 2001 - version 0.5

Added '-d' option to allow for a delimiter other than the pipe
character. Also modified some of the text in the header and footer
files so that newcomers to HTML would be better able to understand
what they should modify. 

---------------------------------------------------
XX May 2000 

Made a number of changes focused on providing multi-line support.
Various changes include:

 - Moved help to separate function - PrintHelp()
 - Added more comments to code
 - Added '-r' to "revert" to original data file format

---------------------------------------------------
21 Apr 2000 

Started using CVS to track changes.

---------------------------------------------------
22 Feb 2000 - version 0.4

I finally figured out how to solve the data sorting issue,
so the changes are:

 - Fixed bug so that FAQ output file now has the categories in
   the order in which they appear in the data file.
 - Added a '-s' switch to do an alphebetical sort on the 
   categories.

Note that if you are upgrading, you may need to now 
reorder your data file to get things to appear in the
same order as they were before.

Additionally, Dave fixed a bug in the text conversion
component of the program related to the removal of
HTML tags when generating a text file ("-c text").
The text file should now be output correctly.

---------------------------------------------------
8 Feb 2000 - version 0.3.1

Dave caught a bug that should have been found before. I changed
some command-line options from "-1" and "-2" to "-t" and "-b"
and didn't update the arguments allowed for the 'getopt'
function... meaning that -t and -b would not work.

---------------------------------------------------
22 Jan 2000 - version 0.3

Substantial changes were made to the code base by Dave
Seidel (dave@superliminal.com). Along with some other changes
by Dan, the results can be summarized as:

  - Changed the default file name for the FAQ data to "faq.dat" 
    instead of "faq.txt"
  - Moved all formatting strings into classes or "configurations".
    The base class, DefaultConfig, corresponds to Dan's original
    settings.  Dave added two additional subclasses, BEASTConfig
    and TextConfig, that respectively define a fancy HTML format
    (designed for http://beast.gtk.org, where Dave am the webmaster)
    and a plain text output.
    (This change allows for the same data file to generate both
    a text and HTML version of the FAQ.)
  - Added command line processing.  It is possible to select
    a configuration, and to override a configuration's settings
    for input, output, header, and footer files.  Use the "-h"
    switch for help on the options.
  - Added some simple error handling.
  - Changed all HTML tags to lowercase (can be changed in configurations)
  - Added a "Table of Contents" header
  - Added closing tags for <li> and <p>
  - Added feedback mechanism so that users know what's going on
    if output is not to STDOUT.
