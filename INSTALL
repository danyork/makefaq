makefaq 
Revision:  2.6
Rev Date:  ?? ??? 2009 
---------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION 

To install makefaq, simply untar or unzip the distribution.
A new directory, 'makefaq-VERSION' (where VERSION is '2.4'
or whatever) will be created. 

You can simply enter that directory, modify the data, header
and footer files, and run the 'makefaq.py' program in that
directory.  

Alternatively, a Makefile is now provided to do all the installation
for you. To use it, type:

  make install

on a system that supports the make command. If you type 'make' alone
you will see the available targets you can use with make.

"makefaq.py" will be copied to an executable location (/usr/local/bin
is the default), "makefaq.1" will be copied to a man location
(default is /usr/local/man/man1) and a documentation directory
will be created with the appropriate docs copied there. (default
is /usr/share/doc/makefaq-VERSION)  All of the locations can be
changed by modifying the variables at the top of the Makefile.

If you wish to only install the man page, leaving all other files 
in the current directory, simply type:

  make man

Note that if you wish you can simply rename the 'makefaq.py' file
to be 'makefaq'.  The '.py' extension is included so that some
operating systems (notably Windows) can easily identify the program.

The Linux/UNIX man page can be copied to /usr/local/man/man1 or
the 'man1' subdirectory of another appropriate man directory tree.

INSTALLATION NOTES

Please read the README file before using makefaq for the
first time.

If you are going to create a FAQ and use the sample
files provided, **PLEASE** change the files (faqheader.html
and faqfooter.html) to provide *YOUR* contact information.  
Because my (Dan) email address is listed in the sample files, 
I have been contacted by several people who came across a 
makefaq-created FAQ somewhere on the Web and could only find 
my address to click on.

By the way, you do not *need* to include the line "This list of 
questions and answers was generated by makefaq..."  I included 
that line purely as a sample. (faqfooter.html)
