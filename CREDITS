 Shortly after the initial release, Dave Seidel provided a very 
 substantial rewrite of the makefaq.py code that was released as part
 of version 0.3 in January 2000.  This reworking made makefaq much more
 configurable and continue to be used in the codebase today.  Dave 
 continued to act as a co-author for the program through 2000. Though
 he is no longer involved directly, his changes made this program as
 flexible and adaptable as it is.

 Beyond Dave, the following people need to be acknowledged for their
 assistance either with direct code or with ideas that led me to the
 right code. The version number in which their contributions was first
 incorporated is in parentheses after their name.

 - Guy Brand for the suggestion to use the locale module and
      the strftime function for localization, also for the
      French phrases (2.0)
 - Nicolas Devillard for his multi-line entry implementation (2.0)
 - Wolfgang Ocker for one multi-line entry implementation and for
      his implementation with gettext (both of which were very useful
      in trying to figure out how to implement both features in 2.0)
 - Wolfgang Ocker and Lenz Grimmer for the German phrases (2.0)
 - César A. K. Grossmann for his Portugeuse phrases (2.1)
 - Michael Wiedmann for catching the PrintTimeStamp bug (2.1) and
      also for packaging makefaq as a Debian package (from 2.0 on)
 - Michael Wiedmann for the man page (2.1)
 - Jerry (??) and Ken Ito for identifying the PrintTimeStamp setlocale
      issue on non-Linux platforms and Gareth Noyce for verifying the 
      problem (2.2)
 - Fabian Melzow for the German JumpString translation (2.4)
 - Bernhard Reiter for the suggestion to move comments about functions
      into actual python docstrings (2.4)
 - Mauro Persano for the Portugeuse JumpString translation (2.4)
 - Wojtek Swiatek for first alerting me to the PEP263 warning (2.5)
