This file documents changes that I would like to see to the
program.  If you would like to work on any of these items,
please feel free to do so and to pass along your changes!

Features
 - Add a "-T" command line option to suppress the creation of
      a Table of Contents.
 - Create ability to read in XML files corresponding to the
      DTD defined for makefaq.
 - Add graphical interface using Tkinter that allows a user
      to specify filename and configure options through a
      GUI. Most likely approach would be to have a 
      'gmakefaq' wrapper that will set up the Tkinter 
      interface and then call the functions of makefaq.

Program
 - Merge ReadOrigSource and ReadPseudoXMLSource into a 
      single function given that the two functions are
      almost identical.
 - Modify the text output to insert a line break after a
      certain number of characters.
 - Modify ReadPseudoXMLSource to be case-insensitive.
      Currently all tags must be in lowercase.
 - Obtain DocBook file for man page and update page from
      that source file.
 - Revisit listing of command-line options in help screen,
      README and man page.  Need to determine best order and 
      make it identical between all listings.
 - Create regression tests to quickly be able to test 
      new version of the program.
 - Figure out a way to deal with umlauts and other accented
      characters with DocBook XML export.  (Currently they
      may cause problems due to encoding issues. The fix may
      be as simple as changing the faqheader.xml file. Then
      again, it may not.)

Distribution
 - Determine mechanism to easily update date and revision
      number across all the files in the distribution.
 - Determine if there is a better and more FHS-compliant
      location for files to be installed.
 - Build RPM for distribution.
